            <p class="drop-capped">My name is Juan Marroquin, and I’m a Stanford-trained Computer Scientist with a concentration in HCI. </p>
            <p class="">My exposure to computers began, like many millennial Computer Scientists, with video games, so naturally some of my greatest joys have been as a result of putting things on a screen.</p>
            <h4>Educational Experience:</h4>
            <p>I originally went to Stanford with the idea of studying Mechanical Engineering, but after taking my first Computer Science class I shifted over because I fell in love with it. Eventually I took the introductory Human-Computer Interaction course and fell in love with that as well. At Stanford I have taken a variety of HCI classes as well as a few CS classes outside of HCI that piqued my interest on top of the core CS classes that all CS majors take to become competent Software Engineers.</p>
            <h4>Research Experience:</h4>
            <p>The summer of 2015 I joined Stanford's HCI Lab for a "research internship", essentially a summer research experience. Working under Michael Bernstein and Niloufar Salehi, my team set out to describe, simulate, and evaluate an internship experience where the interns and mentors are drawn from the crowd in a paper entitled <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858121&CFID=823339788&CFTOKEN=62939183">Atelier: Repurposing Expert Crowdsourcing Tasks as Micro-internships</a>. The paper was accepted into CHI 2016, an HCI focused conference under the ACM that I was grateful to attend.</p>
            <h4>Work Experience:</h4>
            <p>My first CS related job has been doing a bit of web design and development for a friend of a friend. As part of this job I worked with wordpress and a bare bones theme to create a custom website for the <a href="https://wicancer.org/">Wisconsin Comprehensive Control Program</a>. I also made a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seminole-pool-time-converter/id1125822251?ls=1&mt=8">basic time converter app</a> using Adobe phonegap for a Wisconsin pool.</p>
            <p>Later I joined the Computer Science department's <a href="https://cs198.stanford.edu/cs106/ProgramStructure.aspx">Section Leader program</a>. As a Section Leader I lead a section of about ten students in the introductory Computer Science course. This means that I grade their assignments, engage them in one on one interactive grading sessions where we discuss what went right and what went wrong with their program's functionality and style, and lead problem solving sessions where students solve practice programming problems as a class.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2016 I interned at Citigroup as a Tech Analyst. As part of this internship I advised on the development of our web application's redesign, collaborated with the rest of my team in order to establish better coding practices, specifically in regards to CSS and javascript, and contributed to the front-end development of the application in the active development cycle. On top of this I also pioneered <a href="#cucumber">Behavior Driven Development</a> and methods for measuring the impact of our UI/UX changes.</p>

                  <h4>About Atelier:</h4>
                  <p>Atelier as a paper posed the question: what does the crowd work equivalent of an internship look like? In order to answer this question, me and other members of Stanford’s HCI Lab designed a platform for such interactions to take place and measured the effectiveness of these internships based on how much crowd worker interns learned from their crowd worker mentors as well as the quality of their end work.</p>
                  <h4>My Role:</h4>
                  <p>As part of the team I did a number of things ranging from implementation, to design, to reading previous research papers. From my time doing research I learned a lot from my Professor Micahel Bernstein.</p>

                  <h4>About EatVenture:</h4>
                  <p>EatVenture is a project that I worked on for an HCI Design Studio class at Stanford with on a team of three people. EatVenture is a mobile web app built with React and the Google Maps and Yelp APIs that chooses a random restaurant for the user and then navigates them to that restaurant. Inspired by my own tendencies to read too much into online reviews, EatVenture differentiates itself by hiding the end destination from the users until they are literally standing in front of the restaurant.</p>
                  <h4>My Role:</h4>
                  <p>As a design project, my greatest responsibility was to brainstorm with the rest of my team to actually come up with the idea, flesh out the ideas, and perform user studies. To test the concept we found couples to volunteer their date night to us and then we followed them around sending them text messages containing directions to their destination in order to simulate the functionality of the application. In our brainstorming session my role was to advocate for hiding as much information from the user while crucially making them feel like their plans are in good hands.</p>

                  <h4>About LawGrid:</h4>
                  <p>LawGrid is a visualization tool that I designed with two other class mates for a Data Visualization class that is intended to aid in seeing the connections between court cases of interest. This project was inspired by previous work by Aleks Aris and Ben Schneiderman on data exploration. Unlike other existing legal visualization tools such as Ravel and JustCite, LawGrid offers users with a way of filtering out the irrelevant data by having the user start off with cases that they are already interested in and only showing other potentially relevant data points when the user requests them.</p>
                  <h4>My Role:</h4>
                  <p>Like with the other design projects here, I contributed to the team and project through brainstorming sessions and applying my experience in designing interfaces and my newly gained knowledge in data visualization to shape the design. On top of using our own instincts, we collaborated extensively with law students to find out how a visualization tool could aid them. In addition to this my major role was in scraping CaseText, a free website that offered the citation data we would need to make connections. I did this scraping using a combination of a custom chrome extension and python script. Because CaseText uses Angular, I was unable to simply use a headless browser or simply ask for the HTML, so I eventually settled on this dirty solution. </p>

                  <h4>About BDD, Gherkin, and Cucumber-js</h4>
                  <p>Full discolsure, BDD, Gherkin, and Cucumber-js themselves are NOT my own creation, instead I <i>pioneered</i> them as part of my internship at Citigroup. BDD (short for Behavior Driven Development) is a style of software development akin to Test Driven Development with the crucial distinction that effort put towards making entire <i>features</i> of a product work rather than focusing on unit testing (though BDD is often paired with unit testing for completion sake). The beauty of BDD is the language that it uses, Gherkin, which is a plain text structured language that allows developers and stakeholders to more clearly communicate about what exact features a developed product should deliver. Using this structured language opens an organization to living documentation, a framework for testing (in my case Cucumber-js), and the ability to save time by focusing precisely on the desired functionality</p>
                  <h4>My Role:</h4>
                  <p>Being the pioneer of BDD within my team, I had the responsibility of setting a good example of how BDD could be used realistically. I spoke to my manager in order to transcribe the features of a page into a Gherkins file. Afterwards I spoke to an authority within Citigroup on BDD to get some feedback. After I iterated on my Gherkin feature files, I got to work implementing the tests. For this I used selenium-webdriver, cucumber-js, and the Chai assertion library in order to have tests that were almost as readable as the Gherkins files themselves. At the end of my internship I presented our new capabilities and passed on responsibilities of the framework to a new full time worker, which was easy thanks to some well documented code ;).</p>
